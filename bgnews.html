<h1>Low and Slow</h1>

<em><small>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2016-11-15">November 15, 2016</time></small></em><br>

<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <b><dfn>sous vide</dfn></b>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="11-30">November 30.</time></p>
