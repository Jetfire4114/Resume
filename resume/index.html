<h2>Getting to know me</h2>
  <p>᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼I am an up and coming Game Design and Developer curretnly working his way through college. My after-college goal is to one day work for the most renound game developing company, <em>Bungie, Inc</em>. I look forward to learning all sorts of new techniques to better my future game designing career by taking classes on HTML scripting and Photo/Video editing using Adobe to grasp on how to create the scenes for characetrs as well as learning Unreal Engine and Frost Engine to begin modling game characetrs and their respective landscapes.
<br>
<br>᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼᲼With those soon-to-be under my belt, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to work for a game developing company as a future Game Developer. My current and previous works as a designer and <br>developer include, but are not limited to, hostig and writer for a story telling based podacst, writing out book and play scripts in my personal time, as well as ideas for video games that I'll be making in the future. I can be quoted as saying as such, <q><em>I feel that my ideas will draw out what's important in people by having them 'feel' what the character(s) are going through</em></q> about how my creative ideas for books, playwrites, video games, and more will shape the current and next generation of "Gamers".
